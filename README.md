# Drupal pre-commit hook #

For more information [see the blog post on pixelite](http://www.pixelite.co.nz/article/using-git-pre-commit-hooks-keep-you-drupal-codebase-clean). If this script has helped you or you want to leave a comment, you can do so on the blog.

## Possible enhancements ##

* JavaScript linting
* Drupal Code Standards (phpcs + coder) integration
* Having some configuration options (perhaps environment variables?) as to what will cause a the commit to fail, versus a warning

I am also wanting people to submit pull requests as well.
